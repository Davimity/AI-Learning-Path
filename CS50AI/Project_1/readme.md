# Project 1 – Knowledge Representation

This folder contains my solutions for **Project 1** of [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home).

This project introduces symbolic artificial intelligence through the concept of **knowledge representation** and **logical inference**, using propositional logic to model reasoning processes.

## 🧠 Contents

### 📁 `knights`
- **Topic:** Propositional Logic and Model Checking
- **Description:** Solves logic puzzles involving "Knights and Knaves", where knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. The system deduces the identity of each character by building logical models.
- **Techniques Used:** Symbolic knowledge representation, logical conjunctions, satisfiability checking using a model checker.

### 📁 `minesweeper`
- **Topic:** Propositional Logic and Uncertainty
- **Description:** Builds an AI agent that plays the game of Minesweeper by inferring the locations of mines using propositional logic and safe deduction strategies.
- **Techniques Used:** Knowledge base construction, inference using logical rules, model checking, and uncertainty management through logical deduction.

## 🔍 Goal

This project aims to:
- Demonstrate how real-world knowledge can be encoded using logic.
- Practice building and evaluating formal systems that support inference.
- Apply AI reasoning techniques to structured puzzles.
