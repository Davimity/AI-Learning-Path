# Project 0 – Search Algorithms

This folder contains my solutions for **Project 0** of [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home).

The project focuses on foundational **search algorithms**, applying them to real problems to understand how intelligent agents can find optimal solutions in structured environments.

## 🧠 Contents

### 📁 `degrees`
- **Topic:** Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Description:** Finds the shortest connection path between two actors through the movies they’ve appeared in together (similar to the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon").
- **Techniques Used:** BFS, node-based frontier.

### 📁 `tictactoe`
- **Topic:** Adversarial Search / Game AI
- **Description:** Implements a full Tic-Tac-Toe AI agent that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- **Techniques Used:** Minimax recursion, game state evaluation, optimization through pruning.

## ✅ Submission Summary

Each folder includes:
- 📄 Source code implementing the required functionality.
- 🧪 Test results (`check50`) and style check results (`style50`) in a structured table.
- 📸 A screenshot demonstrating the full score and successful submission to edX.

All code is original, developed as part of the coursework, and follows the [CS50 Academic Honesty Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/honesty/).
