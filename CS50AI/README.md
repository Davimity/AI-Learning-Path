# [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020/home)

This directory contains my personal solutions and project implementations for CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, an online course offered by Harvard University through edX.

The course explores foundational concepts in Artificial Intelligence and their practical implementation using the Python programming language. Topics include:

- Search algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS, A*)
- Knowledge representation and logical inference
- Uncertainty and probabilistic models
- Optimization and adversarial search (e.g., Minimax)
- Machine learning fundamentals (classification, regression, neural networks)

The goal of this course is to gain a practical understanding of how modern AI techniques are applied in the real world, while building hands-on experience through guided projects.
